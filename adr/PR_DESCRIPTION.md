# First ADR Publication and Migration to GitHub

## Changes Introduced
- Added first ADR (0001) documenting our decision regarding "Treat Warnings as Errors" policy for .NET development
- Establishes GitHub as the new home for Terumo BCT Applications Architecture ADRs

## Strategic Initiative
This PR represents the first step in migrating our Architectural Decision Records from SharePoint to GitHub. This migration aligns with industry best practices by:

1. Making ADRs more accessible to developers in their natural working environment
2. Enabling version control and change tracking of architectural decisions
3. Facilitating easier collaboration and discussion through PR reviews
4. Integrating architectural documentation directly with our development workflow

## Migration Plan
The Architecture Group will:
1. Review existing ADRs from SharePoint (currently at: https://terumobct.sharepoint.com/sites/rd/crossproductsoftware/Components/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Frd%2Fcrossproductsoftware%2FComponents%2FArchitectural%20Decision%20Records)
2. Gradually migrate and update them to this GitHub repository
3. Ensure all future ADRs are published directly to GitHub

## Reviewers Note
Please review:
- The content and format of the ADR
- The decision documentation clarity
- Any suggestions for improving our ADR process as we move forward with GitHub-based architectural documentation
