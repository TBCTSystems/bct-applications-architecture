## 🔧 CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS

### **1. .NET Build Issues** 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY**

#### Likely Problems:
- **Missing Dependencies**: NuGet packages may not restore properly
- **Target Framework**: Projects may target incompatible .NET versions
- **Package Conflicts**: Version conflicts between dependencies
- **Docker Build Context**: Dockerfile build contexts may be incorrect

#### Investigation Needed:
```bash
# Test each project build
cd src/ProvisioningService && dotnet build
cd src/LumiaApp && dotnet build  
cd src/ReveosSimpleMocker && dotnet build
cd src/DemoWeb && dotnet build

# Check for common issues
dotnet --version                    # Verify .NET SDK version
dotnet restore --verbosity detailed # Check package restoration
```

#### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Verify .NET SDK**: Ensure .NET 8.0 SDK is installed
2. **Update Dependencies**: Review and update NuGet package versions
3. **Fix Project References**: Ensure all project references are correct
4. **Test Docker Builds**: Verify Dockerfile configurations

### **2. Real Certificate Integration** 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY**

#### Current State:
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: step-ca and MQTT are properly configured
- ⚠️ **Applications**: Use self-signed fallback certificates
- ❌ **Integration**: No real end-to-end certificate flow

#### Required Work:
1. **Replace Self-Signed Logic**: Remove fallback certificate generation in applications
2. **Implement Real ACME Clients**: Use proper ACME libraries in .NET applications
3. **Certificate Validation**: Implement proper certificate chain validation
4. **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling for certificate operations

### **3. End-to-End Integration Testing** 🚨 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

#### Missing Components:
- **System Integration Tests**: No complete workflow testing
- **Multi-Component Communication**: Limited testing between services
- **Performance Validation**: No load or stress testing
- **Failure Scenario Testing**: Limited error condition testing
