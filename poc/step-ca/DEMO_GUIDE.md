# üé≠ Enterprise Certificate Management PoC - Demo Guide

## üöÄ Quick Demo Start

### 1. One-Command Demo Launch
```bash
./demo.sh
```

This single command will:
- Start all Docker services
- Initialize step-ca
- Generate certificates
- Configure MQTT broker
- Launch the interactive web interface

### 2. Access the Demo
Open your browser to: **http://localhost:8080**

## üéØ Demo Walkthrough

### Phase 1: System Overview (2 minutes)
1. **Open the Demo Interface** at http://localhost:8080
2. **Observe the System Status** - all services should show as "Healthy"
3. **Review the Architecture** - 5 main components working together
4. **Check Auto-refresh** - data updates every 5 seconds

### Phase 2: Certificate Management (3 minutes)
1. **View Certificate Status** - see all active certificates
2. **Check Expiry Dates** - certificates are valid for 30 days
3. **Monitor Certificate Health** - all should show as valid
4. **Understand the Chain** - step-ca as root CA issuing to all components

### Phase 3: Provisioning Control (2 minutes)
1. **Enable Provisioning Service** - click "Enable Provisioning"
2. **Add IP to Whitelist** - enter `172.20.0.0/16` (Docker network)
3. **Observe Status Changes** - provisioning becomes active
4. **Disable Provisioning** - click "Disable Provisioning"

### Phase 4: Live MQTT Traffic (3 minutes)
1. **Watch Live Messages** - MQTT traffic appears in real-time
2. **Identify Message Types**:
   - Device telemetry data
   - Status updates
   - Heartbeat messages
3. **Observe mTLS Security** - all connections use certificates
4. **Simulate Device Event** - click "Simulate Event" button

### Phase 5: Device Simulation (2 minutes)
1. **Monitor Device Status** - REVEOS-SIM-001 shows as operational
2. **View Device Data** - temperature, pressure, cycle counts
3. **Check MQTT Connection** - device connected via mTLS
4. **Certificate Validation** - device certificate is valid

## üîç Advanced Demo Features

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Auto-refresh Toggle** - enable/disable automatic updates
- **Service Health Indicators** - color-coded status indicators
- **Live Data Streams** - MQTT messages update continuously
- **Certificate Expiry Tracking** - countdown to renewal

### Interactive Controls
- **Provisioning Management** - start/stop certificate provisioning
- **Whitelist Management** - add/remove IP addresses
- **Event Simulation** - trigger device events
- **Message Filtering** - view specific MQTT topics

### System Integration
- **End-to-End Security** - certificates protect all communications
- **Automated Renewal** - certificates renew before expiry
- **Error Recovery** - system handles failures gracefully
- **Scalable Architecture** - supports multiple devices

## üé™ Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Device Onboarding
```bash
# 1. Enable provisioning
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/demo/provisioning/enable

# 2. Add device IP to whitelist
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/demo/whitelist/add \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ipAddress":"172.20.0.100"}'

# 3. Watch device connect and get certificate
# 4. Disable provisioning
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/demo/provisioning/disable
```

### Scenario 2: Certificate Renewal
```bash
# Certificates automatically renew when < 7 days remaining
# For demo, certificates are set to 30-day validity
# Watch the renewal process in the web interface
```

### Scenario 3: MQTT Communication
```bash
# All MQTT traffic is visible in the web interface
# Messages include:
# - Device telemetry (temperature, pressure, etc.)
# - Status updates (operational, maintenance, etc.)
# - Application heartbeats
# - Event notifications
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Behind the Scenes

### What's Actually Happening
1. **step-ca** acts as the root Certificate Authority
2. **Provisioning Service** provides initial certificates with IP restrictions
3. **Mosquitto** enforces mTLS for all MQTT connections
4. **Lumia App** manages certificates and communicates via MQTT
5. **Device Simulator** mimics real device behavior with certificates

### Security Features Demonstrated
- ‚úÖ **mTLS Authentication** - all MQTT connections require certificates
- ‚úÖ **IP Whitelisting** - provisioning restricted to approved IPs
- ‚úÖ **Certificate Validation** - expired/invalid certificates rejected
- ‚úÖ **Automated Renewal** - certificates renew before expiry
- ‚úÖ **Secure Channels** - all communications encrypted

### Architecture Benefits
- üîÑ **Automated Lifecycle** - no manual certificate management
- üõ°Ô∏è **Defense in Depth** - multiple security layers
- üìà **Scalable Design** - supports many devices
- üîß **Operational Control** - admin interfaces for management
- üìä **Monitoring & Visibility** - real-time status and logging
