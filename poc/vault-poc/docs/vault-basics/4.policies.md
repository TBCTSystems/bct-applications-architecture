# Policies

Vault uses **policies** to control access and enforce security rules. Policies define what operations users, applications, or machines can perform within Vault.

Policies are written in **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)** or **JSON**, and they define permissions for specific paths within Vault.

## Default Policies

Vault comes with a few default policies:

- **root**: Grants full administrative privileges. Should only be used in emergencies.
- **default**: Applied to all authenticated entities unless overridden. Provides minimal access.

## Policy Structure

A policy consists of one or more path-based access rules. Each rule defines:

- **Path**: The Vault resource being controlled (e.g., `secret/data/myapp`).
- **Capabilities**: Permissions granted (e.g., `read`, `write`, `list`).

**Example Policy** (HCL format)

```hcl
path "secret/data/myapp" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}
```

This policy allows users to **read** and **list** secrets under `secret/data/myapp`.

### Policy Capabilities

Capabilities define what actions are permitted on a path. Common capabilities include:

- `create`: Allows creating new data.
- `read`: Grants read access.
- `update`: Enables modifying existing data.
- `delete`: Allows deleting data.
- `list`: Permits listing resources in a path.
- `sudo`: Allows performing administrative operations.
- `deny`: Explicitly denies access (overrides other permissions).

### Paths

Vault allows the use of wildcards to simplify policy definitions:

- `` (Glob wildcard): Matches **everything** at a given path level.
    
    ```hcl
    path "secret/data/*" {
      capabilities = ["read", "list"]
    }
    ```
    
    Grants `read` and `list` access to **all** secrets under `secret/data/`.
    
- `+` (Segment wildcard): Matches **only one** path segment.
    
    ```hcl
    path "secret/data/app+/config" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }
    ```
    
    Grants `read` access to secrets in **any subpath** of `app`, like `app1/config`, `app2/config`, etc.
    

If multiple policies apply to a request:

- **The most specific rule wins.**
- If conflicting rules exist, explicit `deny` overrides `allow`.


```hcl
path "secret/data/finance" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
path "secret/data/*" {
  capabilities = ["deny"]
}
```

In this case, access to `secret/data/finance` is denied despite the `read` capability because the wildcard policy explicitly denies access.

## Writing and Managing Policies

```bash
# Listing existing policies
vault policy list 

# Reading a policy*
vault policy read my-policy

# Creating or updating a policy
vault policy write my-policy my-policy.hcl  

# Deleting a policy
vault policy delete my-policy
```

## Assigning Policies

Policies can be assigned to:

1. **Tokens** (direct assignment during creation).
2. **Authentication methods** (linked to user accounts or roles).
3. **Identity entities and groups** (more flexible role-based access control).

**Applying a Policy to a Token**

```bash
# Generate a token with the specified policy
vault token create -policy=my-policy

# Attaching a policy to a Userpass User
vault write auth/userpass/users/myuser policies="my-policy"

# Assigning a policy to an AppRole
vault write auth/approle/role/my-role policies="my-policy"

# Assigning a policy to a TLS certificate authentication
vault write auth/cert/certs/client-cert \
    display_name="client-cert" \
    certificate="$(cat /path/to/client-cert.pem)" \
    policies="cert-policy"
```

## Example: Securing Application Secrets

Imagine a scenario where an application named `webapp` needs access to database credentials stored in Vault.

### **Defining a Policy for `webapp`**

```hcl
path "secret/data/webapp/db" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

This policy ensures that `webapp` can only **read** database credentials but cannot modify them.

## **Applying the Policy to an AppRole**
    
```bash
# Create an AppRole for `webapp`
vault write auth/approle/role/webapp policies="webapp-policy"

# Retrieve the role ID
vault read auth/approle/role/webapp/role-id

# Generate a secret ID**
vault write -f auth/approle/role/webapp/secret-id

# Authenticate `webapp` using Role ID and Secret ID
vault write auth/approle/login role_id=<ROLE_ID> secret_id=<SECRET_ID>
```
    

Now, `webapp` can fetch its database credentials securely using Vaultâ€™s API or CLI.

## Best Practices for Policies

- **Follow the principle of least privilege**: Grant only the necessary permissions.
- **Use deny rules cautiously**: Explicit `deny` rules override other permissions.
- **Organize policies by roles and responsibilities**: Avoid overly permissive policies.
- **Regularly audit policies**: Ensure access control remains secure and compliant.
- **Use separate policies for different applications**: Helps prevent unintended privilege escalation.
- **Leverage wildcards wisely**: Use `*` and `+` when necessary, but avoid overly broad policies.
