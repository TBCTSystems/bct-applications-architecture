# Overview

Vault is a secrets management tool designed to securely store, manage, and control access to sensitive information. It provides mechanisms for authentication, authorization, and auditing, ensuring that only authorized users and applications can access secrets.

## Key Concepts

1. **Authentication:** Users and applications must authenticate using an auth method to obtain a token, which is then used for further interactions.
2. **Authorization (Policies):** Vault uses policies to define who can access what. These policies enforce fine-grained access control.
3. **Secrets Engines:** Vault stores and manages secrets through pluggable backends called secrets engines. Some examples include KV (Key-Value), database credentials, and cloud provider credentials.
4. **Tokens:** Tokens serve as credentials for accessing Vault and are issued upon authentication. They have a lease duration and may require renewal.
5. **Audit Logging:** Vault provides audit logs to track access and modifications, which is essential for security and compliance.
6. **Leases and Dynamic Secrets:** Secrets can have an expiration (lease) and be automatically revoked or rotated.
7. **CLI vs API:** Vault can be accessed via its CLI (`vault` command) or HTTP API (e.g., using `curl`).

## Installation

To use Vault, we need to install it on our system. Below are installation methods for common platforms:

### Fedora (Linux)

```
sudo dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager add-repo --from-repo=https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/fedora/hashicorp.repo
sudo dnf -y install vault
```

### Windows (Using Chocolatey)

```
choco install vault -y
vault version
```

### Running Vault in Development Mode

To quickly start Vault for testing, use **development mode**, which runs an in-memory, non-persistent instance:

```
vault server -dev
```

#### Why `dev` mode?

- Runs **entirely in memory** (does not persist data on disk)
- **No authentication** is required initially
- **Auto-unsealed** (in production, Vault requires unsealing before use)
- Uses **HTTP instead of HTTPS** (insecure for production use)
- Generates a single root token for authentication

For production, Vault should be configured with **persistent storage**, **authentication**, and **TLS encryption**.

## Quick Start Guide

```bash
# Start in dev mode
vault server -dev

# Set vault address
export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200

# Set the root token (replace with the root token)
root_token=ROOT_TOKEN_VALUE

# Log in
vault login $root_token
```
