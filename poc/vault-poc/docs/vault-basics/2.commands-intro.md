# Introduction To Commands

## Ways to Interact with Vault

Vault can be accessed using three primary methods:

1. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: The `vault` command is used for manual operations, automation, and scripting.
2. **HTTP API (cURL or any HTTP client)**: Used for integrating Vault with other applications, automation, or remote management.
3. **Vault UI**: Provides a graphical interface for interacting with Vault, useful for managing policies, secrets, and authentication.

Each method has its own use case. The CLI is most common for everyday use and automation, while the API is useful for programmatic access. The UI is convenient for administrators who prefer a visual approach.

## Command Structure

Vault commands follow a standard structure:

```bash
vault <command> <subcommand> [options] [arguments]
```

- **Command**: The main operation (e.g., `status`, `auth`, `secrets`).
- **Subcommand**: A specific action related to the command (e.g., `enable`, `disable`).
- **Options**: Additional parameters modifying the behavior of the command (e.g., `format=json`).
- **Arguments**: Input values required for the command.

## Basic Examples

```bash
# Checking Vault Status

# Using CLI:
vault status

# Using API (cURL):
curl http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/health  # Fetches Vault's health status
```

```bash
# Initializing Vault (Production Setup)
vault operator init  # Initializes Vault for production (generates unseal keys)
```

```bash
#Listing Available Secrets Engines

# Using CLI:
vault secrets list

# Using API:
curl -H "X-Vault-Token: <token>" http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/mounts  # Lists enabled secrets engines
```

## Setting Environment Variables

To simplify command usage, it is beneficial to store common values in environment variables. This prevents needing to specify options in every command.

### Vault Server Address

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
```

This tells the CLI which Vault instance to communicate with, so you donâ€™t have to specify `-address` every time.

### Skipping Certificate Verification (For Testing Only)

```bash
export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true
```

If Vault is running with self-signed certificates or without proper TLS setup, this allows CLI commands to work without SSL verification errors.

> **Warning:** This is insecure and should never be used in production. In production, ensure Vault uses properly configured TLS certificates.

### Formatting Output for Automation

```bash
export VAULT_FORMAT=json
```

By default, Vault CLI outputs human-readable text. Setting this to `json` makes it easier to process Vault responses in scripts or automation tools.
