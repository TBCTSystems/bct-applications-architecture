# Secrets Engine

Vault’s **secrets engines** provide a way to **store, generate, encrypt, and manage secrets** dynamically. Unlike a traditional key-value store, many secrets engines generate secrets on demand and manage their lifecycle.

Secrets engines are enabled under `/sys/mounts`, and most can be moved or disabled (except for **Cubbyhole**, which is per-token and immutable).

## Secrets Engine Categories

- **Cloud**: Provides temporary cloud credentials (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure service principals, GCP service accounts) to eliminate hardcoded keys in applications.
- **Databases**: Dynamically generates short-lived credentials for relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MSSQL, reducing the risk of credential exposure.
- **Internal**: Includes the Key/Value (KV) engine for static secrets, the Transit engine for encryption, and the Identity engine for managing Vault entities.
- **Identity**: Supports authentication against identity providers like Active Directory and OpenLDAP, enabling role-based access control.
- **Certificates**: Issues and manages SSH keys, PKI certificates, and Venafi-managed secrets for secure system authentication.
- **Tokens**: Generates and manages Vault service tokens and integrates with tools like Consul and Nomad for distributed infrastructure.

## General Secrets Engine Commands

```bash
# List existing secret engines
vault secrets list

# Enable a new secrets engine
vault secrets enable -path=myKV kv

# Tune a secrets engine
vault secrets tune -description="Updated KV Engine" myKV

# Move a secrets engine to a new path
vault secrets move myKV myNewKV

# Disable a secrets engine
vault secrets disable myKV
```

## Key-Value (KV) Engine

The KV engine stores **static secrets** like API keys, database credentials, or certificates.

### **Version 1 vs. Version 2**

| Feature | KV v1 | KV v2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Versioning | No | Yes |
| Performance | Faster | Slightly slower |
| Upgrading | Possible | Cannot downgrade |

```bash
# Enable KV v2
vault secrets enable -path=myKV -version=2 kv

# Store a simple secret
vault kv put myKV/api password="supersecret"

# Store a JSON structured secret (e.g., database credentials)
vault kv put myKV/db-config \
    username="dbuser" \
    password="strongpassword" \
    host="db.example.com" \
    port="5432"

# Read a secret
vault kv get myKV/db-config
```

## Transit Engine

The **Transit** engine provides encryption-as-a-service without storing data. It’s used for:

- **Encrypting & decrypting data**
- **Generating hashes**
- **Signing & verifying data**
- **Creating random bytes**

```bash
# Enable Transit Engine
vault secrets enable transit

# Create an encryption key
vault write -f transit/keys/my-key

# Encrypt data
vault write transit/encrypt/my-key plaintext=$(echo "mydata" | base64)
```

## Identity Engine

The Identity engine maintains **entities and groups** for centralized authentication.

### **Key Features**

- Links multiple auth methods into a single identity
- Manages identity-based policies
- Enables Vault to function as an identity provider

```bash
# List entities
vault list identity/entity/id

# Create an entity
vault write identity/entity name="user1"
```

## Cubbyhole Engine

Cubbyhole is a **per-token storage** engine that cannot be accessed by any other token.

- **Automatically enabled** and tied to service tokens
- **Cannot be disabled or moved**

```bash
# Store a secret in Cubbyhole
vault write cubbyhole/mysecret value="only_for_me"

# Read the secret
vault read cubbyhole/mysecret
```

## Dynamic vs. Static Secrets

- **Static Secrets**: Stored values, manually managed (e.g., KV engine).
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Generated on demand with a lease (e.g., database credentials, AWS IAM keys).

## Response Wrapping

Response wrapping adds an additional layer of security, especially useful when sharing secrets.

```bash
# Wrap a secret for secure transfer
vault kv get -wrap-ttl=60s myKV/api

# Extract the wrapping token
WRAPPED_TOKEN=$(vault kv get -wrap-ttl=60s myKV/api | grep 'wrapping_token' | awk '{print $2}')

# Unwrap a secret
vault unwrap $WRAPPED_TOKEN

# Wrap a generated token
vault token create -wrap-ttl=120s
```
