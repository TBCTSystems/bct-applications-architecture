# Tokens

Vault uses **tokens** for authentication and authorization. Tokens provide access to Vault's resources and are issued upon successful authentication. Tokens have different properties that determine their lifespan, capabilities, and hierarchy.

## Token Creation

Tokens can be created in multiple ways:

1. **From an authentication method**: When a user or application authenticates, Vault issues a token for future use.
2. **Parent Token**: A token can generate child tokens, inheriting certain properties.
3. **Root Token**: The most privileged token in Vault, created in three ways:
    - When Vault is **initialized**
    - By using an **existing root token**
    - Through the **operator command** (requires unseal or recovery keys)

```bash
# Create a new token with a policy and TTL of 60 minutes
vault token create -policy=my-policy -ttl=60m

# Creating a child token
vault token create -policy=limited-access -orphan=false
```

If `-orphan=false`, the new token has a parent and will be revoked when the parent is revoked.

## Root Token

The root token has **unrestricted** access to Vault and never expires. It should be revoked after the initial setup to prevent misuse.

**Use cases for root token:**

- Initial Vault setup
- Emergency situations (e.g., authentication method failure)
- Disaster recovery scenarios

```bash
# **Revoking the Root Token**
vault token revoke -force
```

## Token Properties

Tokens have multiple properties that define their behavior:

- **ID**: The value submitted for authentication and API requests.
- **Accessor**: A unique identifier for looking up the token's properties (except for ID).
- **Type**: Either **service** (persistent, supports child tokens) or **batch** (lightweight, non-persistent).
- **Policies**: Policies associated with the token, defining its permissions.
- **TTL**: The token’s lifespan and renewal settings.
- **Orphaned**: Whether the token has a parent.

### **ID vs. Accessor**

- The **ID** is used to perform actions (e.g., authenticate, access secrets).
- The **Accessor** allows looking up or revoking a token **without knowing the ID**.

**Use cases:**
- Managing child tokens without exposing the ID
- Auditing actions securely

```bash
# Looking up a token
vault token lookup
vault token lookup -accessor <ACCESSOR_ID>
```

```bash
# Checking capabilities for a token
vault token capabilities <TOKEN> <PATH>
vault token capabilities s.TGab123 secret/data/myapp
```

## Batch Tokens vs. Service Tokens

| Feature | Batch Token (`b.`) | Service Token (`s.`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Renewable | No | Yes |
| Child Tokens | No | Yes |
| Stored in Backend | No (in-memory) | Yes (persisted) |
| Performance | High | Lower |
| Use-case | High-throughput apps | Long-term usage |

```bash
# **Creating a Batch Token**
vault token create -type=batch -ttl=30m
```

## Token Lifetime (Time-To-Live - TTL)

A token's lifetime is controlled by:

- **Creation time**: When the token was issued.
- **Creation TTL**: The default lifespan upon creation.
- **Expiration time**: The exact time when the token will expire.
- **Explicit max TTL**: Overrides default TTL (0 if not set).
- **Issue time**: When the token was created.
- **Current TTL**: Remaining time before expiration.

```bash
# Renewing a token
vault token renew <TOKEN>
```

### Effective Max TTL Precedence

The order of precedence for determining max TTL:

1. **System-wide default** (`vault config` settings)
2. **Authentication method settings**
3. **Dynamic token settings**
4. **Default: 32 days if not set**

```bash
# Checking a token's TTL
vault token lookup
```

### Periodic Tokens

**Periodic tokens** are renewable indefinitely (unless explicitly revoked). They require the `sudo` capability to be created.

```bash
# Creating a periodic token
vault token create -policy=my-policy -period=24h
```

This token **must** be renewed within 24 hours, or it will be revoked.

```bash
# Renewing a periodic Token
vault token renew
```

## Token Hierarchy

Tokens follow a parent-child hierarchy:

- A **parent token** can create **child tokens**.
- If a **parent is revoked**, all its child tokens are revoked automatically.

This prevents users from creating child tokens to bypass revocation.

```bash
# Revoking a parent token**
vault token revoke <PARENT_TOKEN>
```

This will revoke **all** child tokens under it.

## Best Practices for Token Management

- **Minimize the use of root tokens** – revoke them after setup.
- **Use batch tokens for high-throughput applications** to reduce storage overhead.
- **Use periodic tokens** where long-lived access is needed but controlled via renewals.
- **Regularly audit tokens** to detect misuse or unused credentials.
- **Use accessors** to track token usage without exposing sensitive token IDs.
