# Authentication

Vault requires authentication before accessing secrets and performing operations. Authentication is done through **auth methods**, which verify the identity of users, applications, or machines.

Once authenticated, Vault issues a **token**, which must be included in all subsequent requests.

## Types of Authentication Methods

Vault provides multiple authentication methods. These can be categorized as:

### **Internal Authentication Methods**

These are managed entirely by Vault and are best suited for human operators or tightly controlled environments.

- **Token Authentication**: A basic method where users authenticate using a Vault-generated token.
- **UserPass (Username & Password)**: Simple username/password authentication, useful for testing but not recommended for production.
- **AppRole**: Designed for applications and services. Uses `RoleID` and `SecretID` to generate a token securely.
- **TLS Certificate Authentication**: Uses client TLS certificates to authenticate users and services securely. Best for machine-to-machine authentication in highly secure environments.

### **External Authentication Methods**

These integrate Vault with external identity providers, making it more scalable for large environments.

- **LDAP**: Integrates with corporate directories (e.g., Active Directory) for user authentication.
- **OIDC (OpenID Connect)**: Allows authentication via identity providers like Google, Okta, and Azure AD.
- **JWT**: Uses JSON Web Tokens for authentication, which are often used with cloud platforms.
- **GitHub**: Allows authentication using GitHub teams and organizations.
- **Kubernetes**: Applications running in Kubernetes clusters can authenticate securely using service accounts.

## Enabling and Configuring an Authentication Method

All authentication methods are managed under `sys/auth`. Before using a method, it must be **enabled**.

```bash
# List Enabled Authentication Methods
vault auth list

# Enable an Authentication Method
vault auth enable approle

# Disable an Authentication Method
vault auth disable approle
```

**Note:** Disabling an authentication method removes access to associated credentials, but if re-enabled, previous settings do not persist.

## Logging in and Obtaining a Token

Once an auth method is enabled and credentials are created, users or applications must log in to obtain a token.

### **Understanding `login` vs. `write` for Authentication**

- `vault login`: Used for interactive authentication methods such as username/password or token-based authentication. It stores the token in the local environment automatically.
- `vault write`: Used for programmatic authentication methods, such as AppRole or Kubernetes, where the login process requires sending credentials and retrieving a token manually.

### Using Token Authentication

```bash
vault login <TOKEN>  
```

### Using Username and Password Authentication

```bash
# Creating a User for Username/Password Authentication
vault write auth/userpass/users/myuser password=mypassword policies=default
```

This command creates a user `myuser` with the specified password and assigns the `default` policy.

```bash
# Authenticate with user credentials
vault login -method=userpass username=myuser password=mypassword  
```

### Using AppRole Authentication

```bash
# This command creates an AppRole with the `default` policy.
vault write auth/approle/role/my-role policies="default"

#To obtain the **Role ID**:
vault read auth/approle/role/my-role/role-id

# To generate a **Secret ID**:
vault write -f auth/approle/role/my-role/secret-id

# Authenticate using AppRole credentials
vault write auth/approle/login role_id=<ROLE_ID> secret_id=<SECRET_ID> 
```

### Using TLS Certificate Authentication

This method allows authentication via a trusted TLS certificate and is commonly used in machine-to-machine authentication.

```bash
# Enable TLS Authentication
vault auth enable cert  # Enable certificate-based authentication

# Configure Client Certificates
vault write auth/cert/certs/my-cert \
    display_name="my-cert" \
    certificate="$(cat /path/to/cert.pem)" \
    policies="default"  # Assign a policy to this certificate authentication

# Authenticate Using a Client Certificate
vault login -method=cert
```

Alternatively, using cURL:
```bash
curl --cert /path/to/client.crt --key /path/to/client.key \
    https://vault-server:8200/v1/auth/cert/login
```

## Using The Token

After logging in, Vault issues a **client token**, which must be included in all requests.

```bash
# Store the token in an environment variable to avoid specifying it in each command
export VAULT_TOKEN=<TOKEN>  
```

Now, every Vault command will use this token automatically, preventing the need to specify it in every request.

## Best Practices for Authentication

- **Avoid using the `root` token** in production. Instead, create policies with least privilege access.
- **Use short-lived tokens** and enable automatic renewal where possible.
- **For applications, use AppRole or Kubernetes authentication instead of storing static credentials.**
- **Integrate with enterprise identity providers** (LDAP, OIDC) for centralized authentication management.
- **Use TLS certificate authentication in secure environments** where password-based methods are insufficient.
